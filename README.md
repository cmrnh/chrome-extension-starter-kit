Fight Club Starter Kit
====================

Code interacting with browser extensions can live in four places:

0. Background scripts
0. Content scripts
0. Injected scripts
0. Your web app

This [Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9916089/4700328) has a great shorthand explanation for each. It also might help to start by taking a look at the [minimum viable Chrome Extension](https://github.com/cmrnh/extension-starter/tree/82bf00934c5e07f0e2c154e0af1f2b4a714d99bb). 

## Installing in Chrome

0. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` and enable `Developer Mode`
0. Click `Load unpacked extension`
0. Navigate to `build/chrome`
